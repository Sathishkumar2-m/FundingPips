          <p>
            No need to rush, you don't build a life in a day. There is plenty of
            time to pass the evaluation successfully, being dynamic is crucial.

          <h1>2. Trading Behaviour and Rules</h1>
          <p>
            2.1. The Student Phase (Phase I) The student phase is to test your
            trading skills while defining yourself as a trader. During the
            student phase, you must achieve a profit target of 8% without
            breaching any other rule and have 3 minimum trading days.‍ <br>
            <br>2.2. The
            Practitioner Phase (Phase II) The practitioner phase is just to
            confirm the results and outcomes of the student phase. During the
            practitioner phase, you must achieve a profit target of 5% without
            breaching any other rule and have 3 minimum trading days. ‍<br> <br>2.3.5%
            Maximum Daily Loss‍ Limit The Maximum Daily Loss is the amount the
            trader is allowed to lose every day. For the purpose of this rule,
            the higher value between equity and balance will be used. This rule
            is set to 5% of the starting equity or balance every day. The rule
            states that the equity of the day, which is the result of the
            currently floating PnL (Profit and Loss) in sum with all closed
            positions of that day, must not hit the Maximum Daily Loss Limit.
            The daily maximum loss resets at 00:00 CE(S)T/server every day.
            ‍<br> <br> 2.4. 10% Maximum Loss Limit The Maximum Loss Limit is the amount
            the equity or balance can't go below. This rule is set to 10% of the
            initial account size. For example, if the trader has a $100.000
            account and the Maximum Loss Limit is 10%, the equity or balance
            can't go below $90.000 at any moment
